                Then as a next step, you can go on and provide a custom radius surrounding that location.
                It will be used to narrow down groupset recommendations for that specific resulting area and its terrain characteristics.
                Additionally you can designate the area with a custom name / description of your choice and let us know under which user name we shall store the information:
            </p>
        </div>
    )
